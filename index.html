                <p>
                So, you've been doing Jumpchain for a while, and you're starting to get a little bored. You're going through the stations of canon, or you're speedrunning "fixing" the setting, or you're ignoring everything to grab that one specific random thing you wanted. You want something new, something to shake things up and make them interesting.
                </p>

                <p>
                To that end, I present to you, humble Jumper or Benefactor, the <strong>Universal Weirdly Specific Drawback Supplement!</strong> These drawbacks aren't anything so vague or prosaic as "resources are harder to come by," nosiree. These drawbacks are highly specific and actionable. Best of all, none of them are legitimately <em>harmful</em> to your character, at most being <em>inconvenient.</em> Rather, they're complications- special considerations to add a little spice to whatever Jump you're doing this time.
                </p>

                <p>
                Now, obviously, you <em>can</em> run these drawbacks however you damn well please, but the <em>intended</em> use is that they're funny. Simple, innocent running jokes. They add a little humanity to your Jumper, creating the appearance- if not necessarily the reality- of someone who is, occasionally, momentarily inconvenienced.

                    So How Do You Use This?
                </h1>

                <p>
                The intended use-case for this document is that, every time you do a Jump, as part of the process of filling out the Jump Doc, you roll some dice against the table and take the Drawback listed where you rolled. No mulligans, no re-rolls, no picking the least-impactful Drawback. You gain no points for the Drawback. Any Companions who import flip a coin, and on heads, must do the same.
                </p>

                <p>
                But, maybe you <em>don't</em> feel like playing it that way. Maybe you're a bit more lenient. There's options, and you're allowed to take as many as you want at no cost- this isn't a Jump Doc, just a list of Drawbacks and a suggested way to use them.
                </p>

                <p>
                The first and most obvious tweak you can make is that these Drawbacks <em>do</em> in fact give points. For that purpose, each Drawback can be assumed to be worth <strong>+200cp.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                Another obvious tweak is that you can now <em>choose</em> to roll for a Drawback, each Jump. Maybe this time you don't want one. Or maybe you want <em>more</em> than one. Gotta get those points somehow. This can, optionally, apply to Companions, too.
                </p>

                <p>
                The third and final obvious tweak is how Drawbacks are picked. You can ignore the dice rolls and just pick directly, or if you still want a <em>bit</em> of randomness, simply allow yourself a set number of mulligans, or even a point cost- no more than what a Drawback can give, otherwise there's no point- to skip the roll <em>this one time.</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                But personally, I do recommend playing it the intended way. It's more fun that way, I think.
